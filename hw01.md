> **1. Digital circuit in everyday life**    
> Digital circuits are used almost everywhere in our daily life. Please give at least five examples of digital circuit in your life and describe its function in one sentence.       

* digital-to-analog converter
  * a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, D/A, D2A, or D-to-A) is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal.

* microprocessor
  * A microprocessor is a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits.

* Class-D amplifier
  * A class-D amplifier or switching amplifier is an electronic amplifier in which the amplifying devices (transistors, usually MOSFETs) operate as electronic switches, and not as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. 

* Graphics processing unit
  * A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. 
* Clock generator
  * A clock generator produces a timing signal (known as a clock signal and behaves as such) for use in synchronizing a circuit's operation. 

> **2. Required number of bits**    
For each of the following, calculate the number of bits needed to uniquely represent the specified item. If you need to make any assumptions, write them down for us.      

**1. A China postal code, for example at Shantou University we have zip code 515063.**
* `12` bits
  
**1. A person living in China.**
* Assume that China's population is `1,395,380,000`, we need `20` bits to uniquely represent every person in China.

> **3. Conversion to 2's complement and vice versa**    

* Convert the following decimal numbers into their 2's complement representation, assuming 8-bit notation. Show your work.
1) 125  
2) -97    

**Answer 1:**
````
125/2=62 ......1    
62/2=31  ......0    
31/2=15  ......1     
15/2=7   ......1    
7/2=3    ......1    
3/2=1    ......1     
1/2=0    ......1     
```` 
So $(125)_{10}=(1111101)_{2}$    
Convert to 2's complement, the answer is $01111101$

**Answer 2:**
````
97/2=48  ......1
48/2=24  ......0
24/2=12  ......0
12/2=6   ......0
6/2=3    ......0
3/2=1    ......1
1/2=0    ......1
````
So $(97)_{10}=(1100001)_{2}$    
Convert to 2's complement, the answer is $10011111$

* Convert the following 2's complement numbers into their decimal representation. Show your work.
1) 10110100 
2) 01010000

**Answer 1:**    
Since the first bit of the number is `1`, the number is negative. This implies that its correspond positive number is `01001100`. 

$(1001100)_2=1×2^6+0×2^5+0×2^4+1×2^3+1×2^2+0×2^1+0×2^0=(76)_{10}$

So the answer is `-76`.

**Answer 2**    
Since the first bit of the number is `0`, the number is positive.

$(1010000)_2=1×2^6+0×2^5+1×2^4+0×2^3+0×2^2+0×2^1+0×2^0=(80)_{10}$

So the answer is `80`.

> **4. Sorting**    
> Order the following numbers in ascending order assuming 5-bit unsigned binary numbers. Remember the different notations for binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers.
> * 01001, x13, 13
> * x1D, 17, 10101

**Answer**

$(0x13)_{16}=(10011)_2$    
$(13)_{10}=(1101)_2$    
$(0x1D)_{16}=(11101)_2$    
$(17)_{10}=(10001)_2$

So we have $01001, 10011, 01101, 11101, 10001, 10101$    
Sort in ascending order, the result is:    
$17, 13, 10001, 0x13, 10101, 0x1D$    

> **5. Unsigned binary representation vs. 2's complement**    
> Order the next two sequences of numbers in ascending order twice. First, assume that the numbers are written in 8-bit unsigned binary and then in 8-bit 2's complement representation.

**Answer 1**

$(0xE3)_{16}=(11100011)_2$    
$(0x14)_{16}=(00010100)_2$    
$(0xA1)_{16}=(10100001)_2$    
$(0xC2)_{16}=(11000010)_2$    

So we have    
$01110101, 11001101, 11100011, 00010100, 10010110, 00101110, 10100001, 11000010$
Sort in ascending order, the result is:    
$0x14, 00101110, 01110101, 10010110, 0xA1, 0xC2, 11001101, 0xE3$

**Answer 2**

If we use 9-bit 2's complement representation, Convert the following 2's complement negative numbers to their positive form, we got     
$(10010110):01101010$  
    <!-- origin -->
$(10100001):01011111$    
<!-- 0xA1 -->
$(11000010):00111110$   
 <!--0xC2  -->
$(11001101):00110011$    
<!-- origin -->
$(11100011):00011101$    
<!-- 0xE3 -->

Sort them in ascending order, we got    
$00011101, 00110011, 00111110, 01011111, 01101010$

So the answer is
$10010110, 0xA1, 0xC2, 11001101, 0xE3, 0x14, 00101110, 01110101$

> **6. Hexadecimal representation**    
> Order the following numbers in ascending order. Assume unsigned representation.

Convert all not-hex number to hexadecimal number:    
$(10)_{10}=(0xA)_{16}$    
$(27)_{10}=(0x1B)_{16}$     
$(37)_{10}=(0x25)_{16}$    
$(162)_{10}=(0xA2)_{16}$     
$(175)_{10}=(0xAF)_{16}$    

Sort in ascending order, the answer is:    

$10, 0xB, 27, 0x21, 37, 0x30, 0xA1, 162, 0xAC, 175$

> Should there be a global language, and if so, what should it be?

# Music is the global language

From my perspective, music is the global language. Although many people in the world speak English, music is the only one that can be called a "Global language".


Firstly, music can convey emotions like happiness and sadness across cultural and linguistic boundaries in ways that you can't with ordinary languages like English or Chinese. You don't have to speak Chinese to enjoy a exciting music by Jay Chou just like you don't need English skill to feel the intensive emotion performed by Coldplay. Even animals like bunny and kitty can enjoy music! Music does have the magic to spread emotions no matter where you are or what you are.

Secondly, recent research shows that music across the world share almost the same tone for happiness and sadness. This reveals that music have its own pattern and "grammar" -- the same to ordinary languages like English and Chinese. Almost everyone in this world can understand emotions reflected by different tones in music. Anyone who are used to these "grammar" can use music to "communicate" with everyone (Even animals) in the world!

In conclusion, music is the global language since it is easy for everyone to understand as well as it can be easily composed. If you want to communicate with every living things in the world, use music as your tool.
